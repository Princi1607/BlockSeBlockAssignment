What is Blockchain?
A blockchain is like a digital notebook that everyone can see but no one can easily change. It stores information in "blocks" that are linked together in a chain. Once something is written in a block, it’s very hard to change, making it safe and secure. Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block — which creates a tamper-proof history. Blockchains don’t rely on one central authority; instead, everyone in the network has a copy, and they agree (reach consensus) on what is true. This makes it trustworthy for things like money, contracts, or record-keeping.

2 Real-Life Use Cases
Supply Chain Management
Blockchain helps track products from origin to delivery. For example, it can trace where a fruit was grown, processed, and sold, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud.

Digital Identity
Blockchain allows individuals to own and control their identity securely, reducing identity theft and simplifying verification processes (like logging into government services).

What is a Merkle Root?
The Merkle root is like a digital fingerprint of all the transactions in a block. It is created by hashing all transaction data in pairs until one final hash remains. This final hash is the Merkle root.

Consensus Conceptualization
Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of Work is like a race where computers compete to solve a complex math puzzle. The first one to solve it gets to add a new block to the blockchain and is rewarded. Solving this puzzle needs a lot of computing power, which is why PoW consumes a lot of electricity. It ensures security because tampering would require redoing the work for all blocks — which is nearly impossible.

Proof of Stake (PoS)
In Proof of Stake, there’s no race. Instead, validators are chosen to create new blocks based on how many coins they "stake" (lock up). The more coins you stake, the higher your chances. PoS uses much less energy than PoW because it doesn't require heavy computing. It's like voting with money instead of solving puzzles.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
Delegated Proof of Stake is like a democracy. Token holders vote to elect a small group of validators who create new blocks on their behalf. These selected validators take turns to validate transactions. It’s fast and efficient, but more centralized than PoW or PoS because only a few people are chosen to validate at a time.
